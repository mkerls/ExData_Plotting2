### Plot 1
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

### Plot 2
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the  **Baltimore City** (`fips == 24510`) from 1999-2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

### Plot 3
Of the four types of sources indicated by the `type` (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999-2008 for **Baltimore City**? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999-2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

### Plot 6
Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in **Baltimore City** with emissions from motor vehicle sources in **Los Angeles County** (`fips == 06037`). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
